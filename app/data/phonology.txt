Overview
This session introduces phonology, focusing on phonemic analysis and the formation of phonological rules. It aims to differentiate between phonetics and phonology, and explores how sounds pattern in language.

Main Topics Covered
1. Understanding Phonology
Definition and exploration of phonology as a study of sound patterns in language.
Differentiation between phonology and phonetics.
2. Phonemic Analysis
Methods to determine which sound changes affect meaning and which are predictable.
Exploration of the concepts of phonemes, allophones, and free variation.
3. Phonological Rules
Writing and understanding phonological rules.
Utilizing specific symbols and notations for phonological analysis.
4. Practical Phonemic Analysis
Application of phonemic analysis through various examples and data sets.
Key Concepts
Phonemic Analysis: Differentiating between meaningful sound changes (phonemes) and predictable, non-meaningful changes (allophones).
Phonological Rules: Specific notations used to describe how sounds change in different environments.
Contrastive vs. Complementary Distribution: Understanding how sounds can be interchangeable or context-dependent.
Perception in Phonology: How different sounds are perceived and categorized by speakers of a language.
Practical Applications
Application of phonemic analysis in determining language patterns.
Writing phonological rules to explain sound changes in specific linguistic contexts.
Special Focus
Phonetic Variation: Discussion on how the same phoneme can have different allophones based on the environment.
Practical Examples: Hands-on analysis of phonological data from various languages, including English and Russian.
Additional Discussions
The Wug Test: An exploration of how speakers apply linguistic rules to novel situations.
Theoretical Linguistics: Questions related to modeling human language and grammar, and the cognitive reality of these models.
Concluding Remarks
Emphasizing the importance of phonology in understanding language structure.
Encouragement to engage with phonology beyond the basics, hinting at more complex topics for future sessions.

Overview
This session delves deeper into phonology, focusing on common phonological processes, natural classes, and practical problem-solving.

Main Topics Covered
1. Review of Phonemic Analysis
Revisiting the concepts of phonemes, minimal pairs, allophones, underlying forms, allomorphs, and free variation.
2. Common Phonological Processes
Exploring four key phonological processes: assimilation, dissimilation, insertion/epenthesis, and deletion/elision.
3. Natural Classes
Understanding how sounds can be grouped based on shared phonetic properties.
4. Problem Solving in Phonology
Applying phonological concepts to solve practical problems and datasets.
Key Concepts
Phoneme: The smallest contrastive unit of sound in a language.
Minimal Pairs: Two words differing by a single sound, indicating different phonemes.
Allophones: Different expressions of the same phoneme.
Underlying Form: The 'base' form of a phoneme from which allophones are derived.
Allomorphs: Different versions of morphemes that change predictably.
Free Variation: Random, patternless sound variations.
Phonological Processes
Assimilation: Sounds becoming more similar to each other.
Dissimilation: Sounds becoming less alike.
Insertion/Epenthesis: Adding sounds to avoid awkward combinations.
Deletion/Elision: Removing sounds to avoid awkward combinations.
Natural Classes
Grouping of sounds based on shared phonetic properties.
Example: Voiceless stops in English are [p, t, k].
Practical Applications
Using phonological concepts to analyze language data.
Understanding how phonological rules explain sound changes.
Special Focus
Phonetic Relationships: Exploring how phonological rules often involve natural classes of sounds.
Practical Examples: Analyzing datasets from various constructed languages to apply phonological concepts.
Additional Discussions
Study Group Caveats: Highlighting the importance of understanding answers, not just memorizing them.
Role of Phonology: Discussing why understanding phonology is essential for language study.

Overview
This session extends the exploration of phonology to signed languages and delves into syllables, phonotactics, and the influence of language background on phonology.

Main Topics
1. Signed Language Phonology
Phonological aspects of signed languages, including parameters like handshape, orientation, movement, location, and expression.
Discussion of similarities and differences between signed and spoken language phonologies.
2. Syllables
Examination of syllables and their importance in languages like English.
Breakdown of syllables into onset, nucleus, and coda.
3. Phonotactics
Study of legal sound combinations and structures in languages.
Exploration of phonotactic constraints in various languages and how they handle word borrowings.
4. Q/A on Phonology
Addressing questions and clarifications related to phonology, including terms like phoneme, allophone, minimal pair, and natural class.
5. Language Background and Phonology
Discussion on how language background affects phonological aspects and accents.
Evaluation of concepts like native speaker, L1 and L2, and heritage speakers.
Key Concepts
Phonological Parameters in Signed Languages: Understanding how different aspects of sign language function like phonetic features in spoken languages.
Syllable Structure: Analyzing the structure of syllables in various words and their phonological significance.
Phonotactics and Constraints: Studying the rules governing sound combinations in different languages and their impact on language structure.
Language Background Influence: Exploring how an individual's language background influences their phonology and language use.
Special Focus
Signed Languages: Highlighting that phonological principles apply to both spoken and signed languages, with examples in American Sign Language (ASL).
Phonological Processes in Signed Languages: Demonstrating how assimilation, dissimilation, epenthesis, and deletion occur in sign languages.
Syllable Parts: Detailed look at the parts of a syllable – onset, nucleus, coda – using English examples.
English Aspiration: Discussion on the aspiration of /t/ in English and its phonological implications.
Phonotactic Examples: Comparative study of phonotactic constraints in languages like English, Russian, Czech, Japanese, and Hawaiian.
Language Borrowings: Examining how languages like Hawaiian and Japanese adapt borrowed words to fit their phonotactic constraints.
Practical Applications
Understanding Signed Language Phonology: Recognizing minimal pairs and phonological rules in ASL.
Analyzing Syllables: Practicing the breakdown of syllables in various words.
Exploring Phonotactics: Analyzing how different languages allow or restrict certain sound combinations.
Language Background in Linguistics: Considering the complexities of defining language fluency and background.
