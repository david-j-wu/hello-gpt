How does speech work?
The Speech Process
Speech involves creating vibrations in the air through vocal mechanisms.
Phonetics is the study of this process.
Speech Production Organs
The Lungs: Provide the air needed for speech.
Articulators ("flapping bits of meat"): These articulate to produce distinct speech sounds.
Phonetics and Anatomical Terms
You will not be responsible for any anatomical terms not required for transcription on exams.
The Tongue
Plays a crucial role in shaping speech sounds.
Speech Complexity
Speech consists of fluid, overlapping gestures.
It is more complex than we typically perceive.
Understanding Speech Through Phonetics
Speech is broken into 'segments' or 'phones'.
Transcription allows us to represent what is said phonetically.
Writing System Limitations
English writing system does not accurately represent speech sounds.
The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
A system for transcribing speech sounds.
Focuses on describing individual phones.
Can transcribe speech in any human language or dialect.
Using IPA
Involves writing down the sequence of sounds being produced, not the written words.
Example: "Black Lives Matter" transcribed as /blæk lajvz mæɾəɹ/ in a particular dialect.

Describing Speech Sounds
Describing Consonants
Consonants are described by:
Place of Articulation: Where is the sound made?
Manner of Articulation: What action is being performed at that place?
Voicing: Is the larynx buzzing or not?
Places of Articulation
Examples include Bilabial, Labiodental, Interdental, Alveolar, Postalveolar, Velar, and Glottal.
Manner of Articulation
Types include Stops, Taps, Fricatives, Nasals, Approximants, and Laterals.
Voicing in Consonants
Differentiates between voiced and voiceless sounds.
Describing Vowels
Vowels are described based on tongue position (height and front-back) and lip rounding.
Examples include /i, ɪ, ɛ, æ, ə, ʌ, ɑ, ɔ, ʊ, u/.
English Vowel Sounds
English has multiple vowel sounds, often not accurately represented in writing.
Distinguishes between monophthongs and diphthongs.
