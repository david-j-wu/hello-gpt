Overview
An exploration of pragmatics, focusing on the application of Grice's Maxims and other pragmatic concepts in language.
Main Topics Covered
1. Grice's Maxims
Review of Grice's Maxims: Quality, Quantity, Relevance, and Manner.
Discussion on how these maxims guide cooperative conversation.
2. Violating vs. Flouting Maxims
Distinction between violating (being uncooperative) and flouting (intentionally violating for specific meanings) maxims.
Examples illustrating the comedic and conversational effects of flouting maxims.
3. Presupposition
Concept of presuppositions: implicit assumptions in discourse.
Differences between presuppositions and entailments, especially in negation contexts.
4. Conversational Implicature
Understanding conversational implicature: suggestions not explicitly expressed or entailed.
Analysis of how implicatures depend on cooperative principles and context.
5. Speech Acts and Performative Speech
Introduction to speech acts: sentences that accomplish actions by being uttered.
Characteristics of speech acts, including their dependence on context and social roles.
6. Deixis
Exploration of deictic expressions: words whose meanings depend on conversational context.
Examples of deictic words including pronouns, temporal expressions, and locatives.
Key Concepts
Maxim Violation and Flouting: Understanding the implications of not adhering to conversational norms.
