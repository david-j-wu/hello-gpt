Analysis of form-meaning correspondences.
Examples: English plurals and past tense markers.

Morphological Types in Languages
Morphological Type: A category that describes how languages form words.
Focus on two aspects: the number of morphemes in words and their distinctiveness in a language.
Isolating Languages: Like English and Chinese, with few morphemes per word.
Synthetic Languages: Like Spanish and German, featuring many morphemes per word.
Polysynthetic Languages: Where entire sentences can form a single word.
Examples of Morphological Types
English (Isolating): Simple structure with minimal morphemes.
Russian (Synthetic): Multiple morphemes in single words.
Turkish (Synthetic): High morpheme density in words.
German: Complex compound words.
Wichita: Example of a polysynthetic language.
Derivational vs. Inflectional Morphology
Derivational Morphology: Forming new words by attaching affixes that change the meaning or part of speech.
Inflectional Morphology: Modifying words to fit grammatical roles without changing the core meaning or part of speech.
Examples
Derivational: From 'control' to 'controllable', 'amaze' to 'amazement'.
Inflectional: English plural marker '-s', past tense marker '-ed'.
