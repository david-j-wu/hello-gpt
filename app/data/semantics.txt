Overview
Introduction to the study of meaning in language, focusing on semantics and pragmatics.
Exploration of truth in sentences, ambiguity, entailment, connotation vs. denotation, and prototype theory in semantics.
Main Topics Covered
1. Truth in Sentences
Understanding how sentences can be true or false.
Concepts like tautologies, contradictions, meaningless sentences, non-statement sentences, and speech acts.
2. Ambiguity
Different kinds of ambiguity: syntactic/structural, lexical, and semantic.
Examples and explanations of each type.
3. Entailment
The concept of entailment in sentences, where one statement logically implies another.
Examples demonstrating what is and isn't entailed by a given sentence.
4. Connotation and Denotation
The difference between connotation (associative/emotional aspects) and denotation (literal meaning) of words.
Discussion on synonyms, euphemisms, and how connotations can change over time.
5. Prototype Theory
Exploring the concept of semantic prototypes and how they influence our understanding of word categories.
Interactive examples with the class to illustrate the gradient nature of word meanings.
Key Concepts
Tautologies and Contradictions: Understanding sentences that are always true or always false.
Syntactic, Lexical, and Semantic Ambiguity: Recognizing when a sentence can have multiple interpretations.
Entailment: The logical relationship between statements where one implies the truth of another.
Connotation vs. Denotation: Differentiating between the emotional/associative meaning and the literal meaning of words.
Semantic Prototypes: The idea that some examples of a category are more "central" or "typical" than others.
Practical Applications
Gaining the ability to analyze the truth and meaning of sentences in a logical way.
Developing an understanding of how words can convey different meanings in different contexts.
Recognizing the nuances in language that impact communication and interpretation.
Concluding Remarks
Emphasizing the complexity of meaning in language and its importance in linguistics.
An invitation to think more deeply about how we define and understand words and sentences.
A teaser for the next lectures focusing on individual word meanings and meaning in context.

Main Topics Covered
1. Word Meaning Relationships
Analysis of how words relate to each other, including synonyms, antonyms, homonyms, homophones, hyponyms, hypernyms, and metonymy.
Examples to illustrate each relationship.
2. Polysemy and Word Sense
Concept of polysemy: one word having multiple meanings.
The idea of word sense: specific meaning of a word in a given situation.
3. Verb Frames and Semantic Roles
Each verb has a 'frame' that specifies its expected arguments.
Introduction to semantic roles, such as Agent, Source, Experiencer, etc.
4. Pragmatics and the Cooperative Principle
Pragmatics focuses on meaning in a discourse context.
Introduction to the Cooperative Principle and Gricean Maxims: Quality, Quantity, Relation, and Manner.
Key Concepts
Word Relationships: Understanding the nuances in the relationships between different words.
Polysemy: Recognizing that words can have multiple meanings based on context.
Verb Frames and Semantic Roles: Identifying how verbs structure sentences and their participants.
Cooperative Principle and Gricean Maxims: Fundamental guidelines in conversation for effective communication.
Practical Applications
Gaining insights into how words interconnect and convey meanings in different contexts.
Developing skills to analyze and understand complex sentence structures.
Learning how conversational implicatures and cooperation impact communication.
Additional Discussions
Violating Maxims: Understanding how conversation dynamics change when these maxims are intentionally or unintentionally broken.
Maxim Violation Examples: Analyzing real-world examples and hypothetical scenarios where maxims are not followed.
Practical Relevance: Emphasizing how pragmatics play a crucial role in everyday communication.
Concluding Remarks
Emphasizing the complexity and richness of language meaning, both in individual word usage and conversational contexts.
A teaser for further exploration of pragmatics in the next lecture, focusing on meaning in specific contexts.
