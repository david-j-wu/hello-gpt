Overview
An introduction to phonetics, focusing on the mechanics of speech production, transcription, and the classification of consonants and vowels.
Main Topics Covered
1. Introduction to Speech Production
Exploration of how speech works, including the roles of lungs, vocal tract, and articulators.
Explanation of the speech process as vibrations in the air interpreted by the ear.
2. The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
Introduction to the IPA as a tool for transcribing speech sounds accurately, regardless of the language.
Emphasis on using IPA to transcribe what is said, not what is written.
3. Describing Consonants
Three key aspects for describing consonants: Place of Articulation, Manner of Articulation, and Voicing.
Detailed explanation of each aspect, including examples and related exercises.
4. Describing Vowels
Description of vowels in terms of tongue height (high, mid, low), tongue position (front, central, back), and lip rounding.
Introduction to diphthongs and their distinction from monophthongs.
5. Consonants and Vowels in Mainstream US English
Overview of the variety of consonants and vowels present in mainstream US English.
Discussion on the number of vowels in English and common misconceptions due to the writing system.
Key Concepts
Speech Mechanics: The physiological process of producing speech sounds.
IPA: A standardized system for phonetic transcription.
Consonants: Classified by place, manner, and voicing.
Vowels: Classified by tongue height, position, and lip rounding.
Diphthongs: Vowels where the tongue moves through the mouth during articulation.
Practical Applications
Using IPA to transcribe speech accurately for linguistic analysis.
Understanding the complexity and diversity of sounds in human languages.
Recognizing the limitations and inaccuracies of traditional writing systems in representing speech sounds.
Additional Discussions
The Unreliability of Writing Systems: Highlighting the discrepancies between written and spoken language.
Variations in English Pronunciation: Differences in vowel and consonant sounds across English dialects.
Speech Experiments: Engaging students in practical exercises to understand speech production.
Concluding Remarks
Emphasizing the importance of phonetics in understanding human language.
Encouraging students to think critically about the sounds of language beyond the written form.
Overview
A continuation of Phonetics I, this session delves deeper into the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), explores speech perception, and highlights the incredible complexity and capability of human speech.
Main Topics Covered

2. Transcription Challenges and Pitfalls
Exploration of common transcription errors and how to avoid them.
Discussion on the limitations and deceiving aspects of the English writing system.
3. Speech Perception and Its Complexities
Introduction to speech perception, focusing on how humans interpret and understand spoken language.
Presentation of various auditory illusions and perception experiments.
4. Special Topics in Phonetics
Discussion on tone languages and the use of pitch in language.
Exploration of clicks in African languages, debunking misconceptions.
Examination of how coarticulation affects speech perception.
Key Concepts
IPA Proficiency: Enhancing skills in phonetic transcription using the IPA.
Speech Perception: Understanding how humans decode and interpret spoken language.
Coarticulation: The influence of surrounding sounds on the pronunciation of a phoneme.
Tone and Click Languages: Special phonetic features in specific language families.
Phonetic Variability: Emphasizing the uniqueness of each individual's speech.
Practical Applications
Applying advanced IPA transcription skills to various languages.
Appreciating the complexity of human speech perception and production.
Understanding the role of pitch and tone in language.
Special Focus
Misconceptions about Language: Addressing and correcting common misunderstandings about non-English languages, particularly African languages with click consonants.
Auditory Illusions and Experiments: Engaging in perception tasks to demonstrate the complexities of speech perception.
Additional Discussions
Speech Production and Perception: Insights into how spoken language is produced and perceived, highlighting human linguistic capabilities.
IPA in Practice: Using the IPA to transcribe diverse and challenging speech samples.
Linguistic Diversity: Celebrating the wide range of phonetic elements found in languages worldwide.
Concluding Remarks
Emphasizing the incredible ability of humans to produce and understand complex speech.
