**Linguistics Overview**
- **Definition and Scope**: Linguistics is the study of language, focusing on how language functions in human communication. It encompasses the examination of specific languages like Spanish, Laotian, Russian, and Kumeyaay.
- **Complexity of Language**: Explores nuances in language, such as phonetic variations, meanings of words, and grammatical constructs. Example question: Why is there a [t] sound in "quacked" instead of a [d]?

**Branches of Linguistics**
- **Theoretical Linguistics**: Concerns with describing communication methods, exploring language models, and understanding language evolution.
- **Linguistic Typology**: Investigates common patterns across languages, universal tendencies, and language capabilities.
- **Experimental Linguistics**: Includes techniques like Pneumotachography, Electromagnetic Articulography, and Neurolinguistics.
- **Other Areas**: Language Documentation, Computational Linguistics, Forensic Linguistics, Conlanging (e.g., Dothraki, Na'vi), and Lexicography.

**Computational Linguistics Applications**
- Tasks include Automatic Summarization, Information Extraction, Ad Targeting, Sentiment Analysis, Pattern Recognition, and more.

**Forensic Linguistics Applications**
- Analyzing emergency calls, authorship attribution, voice identification, etc.

**Language Modalities**
- Spoken languages with speech and gesture.
- Written languages, some sharing the same writing systems.
- Signed languages using gestures and facial expressions.
- Tactile languages like Braille and ProTactile.

**Linguistic Studies**
- Focus on all language forms, including "non-standard" or newly coined terms (e.g., "Rizz", "sus").
- Exploration of grammar, rules, and evolving language uses.

**Characteristics of Language**
- Arbitrary sign and signified relationships.
- Full productivity and creativity, allowing for infinite unique sentences and descriptions.
- Knowledge of grammar and rules by speakers.

**Universal Grammar and Linguistic Structure**
- Universal Grammar posits innate language properties.
- Debates exist regarding the biological basis for language.

**Language Variation**
- Dialects, sociolects, and idiolects reflect geographical, social, and individual language differences.
- Examples of regional dialect variations in syntax and pronunciation.

**Language and Thought**
- Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis examines how language influences thought.
- Various degrees of linguistic relativity are debated.

**Linguistic Prescriptivism vs. Descriptivism**
- Prescriptive Grammar focuses on socially dictated "correct" language use.
- Descriptive Grammar describes how people actually use language, embracing all dialects and forms.
