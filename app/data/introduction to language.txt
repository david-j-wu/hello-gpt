What is Linguistics?
Linguistics study Language, interested in how “Language” works for humans
And we study it by looking at Spanish, or Laotian, or Russian, or Kumeyaay
Learning languages can be a part of that, but it’s not the whole
We’re interested in Capital L Language even as we’re studying individual languages

Language is complex
“The duck quacked gleefully at his bae”
How did I make that sequence of sounds and how did you recognize it?
Why is there a [t] at the end of quack rather than a [d]?
What does that last sound mean anyways?
Who quacked at whom? When? How do we know?
What was gleeful?
What’s a “bae” anyways? Can a duck have a bae?

Why does anybody care about Linguistics?
Theoretical Linguistics
How can we describe how people communicate?
How can we describe the things people don’t do?
What are the best models to help us understand language?
What are the best models which mirror our own cognition?
How does language change over time?
Linguistic Typology
How do languages generally accomplish communicative goals?
Are there patterns across the world?
What kinds of things are languages more and less likely to do?
Are there universal tendencies in language?

Conlanging, Creating new languages for fun
Examples are Dothraki, High Valyrian, Na'vi, Languages from Dune

Lexicography
Where a word came from, its origins, what it means for different people and communities

Consonants (non-pulmonic)

Not all languages use the same modality
Spoken languages use speech to express meanings
We’re familiar with this, but even spoken language involves gesture and visual cues

Written language is used to express meanings
Like this!
Not all languages have writing systems, some different languages use the same writing system, some people can only understand each other in writing

Signed language use gesture, facial expression, and movement to express meanings

Other languages are felt
Braille is touch-based writing system for English
ProTactile is an emerging language designed to be used by folks who are both Deaf and Blind

Languages have unique terms and structures to discuss the world

Linguists study all language, not just “proper” language
New language has studyable meaning too
“Rizz”, “sus”
This shows we have intuitions about all language use
We can talk about any words, even new word,s being grammatical or not
We know when any language that we use is being used properly
Words have legitimate and correct meanings, even if they’re not in the dictionary
The -ussy suffix (ug bussy, pizzussy) was the American Dialect Society’s 2022 “Word of the Ear”

Language
A system of linking expression to meaning

What characteristics does a language have?
Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified
Fully Productive and Creative
Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language

Language has “signs” and “signified” concepts
The sign is something a human does in communication
The 'signified' is something in the world (conceptual or concrete)
What is the link between these?

Non-arbitrary signs
The sign is causally linked to the signified
Smoke is a sign of fire
Bleeding from your finger is a sign of a papercut

Iconic (or representational) signs
A referential abstraction from the signified
Hand gestures, sounds meant to “mimic” the world

Arbitrary signs
Referential only by agreement and widespread knowledge
Non-representational symbols or uses of symbols

The most important arbitrary signifiers are words
The connection between words and meanings in language is (mostly) arbitrary
The connection between sound and meaning is mostly arbitrary in spoken Language
Signed languages have arbitrary signs too, but there are often elements of iconicity in signs

Spoken language has moments of iconicity too
Onomatopoeia
Differs across language
The best evidence for arbitrariness: Words differ across languages
If the link between signifier and signified were non-arbitrary, everybody would have substantially similar words for concepts, but we do not
Characteristic 1
Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified
Characteristic 2
Languages are fully productive and creative
Characteristic 3
Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language

Languages are capable of describing anything (eventually)
Might take time, might require some words to be "circumlocutory" or invented, might require incredible skill

Languages are also capable of producing an infinite set of unique sentences
Any human speaker of a language can produce a sentence that nobody has ever spoken before
And sentences can be infinitely grown and expanded
This particular property is called recursion: Sentences can be made to contain elements from other sentences infinitely

Creativity and Productivity is true of all languages
We have yet to discover a language which is communicatively 'primitive' or unable to describe reality
If a language lacks elements, they will be developed or borrowed over time
Languages can differ substantially still
A given language may lack words for some concepts
Or may have words that other languages don't have
Many words and concepts are culturally based, and may not be shared regardless
Every natural human language that we've found is able to express a rich set of meanings

You can make grammaticality judgements
Grammaticality judgements are about language, not individual words

We as speakers have strong feelings about the 'correctness' and 'rules' of language
But not so much for other kinds of basic communicative gestures

There are other characteristics that are important in human Language
Language is symmetrical (we can send and receive)
Language can talk about situations not in the “here and now”
Language is made of discrete, isolatable units (like words or sounds)
Language has slang, taboo words
Language accomplishes certain functions (ex asking questions, issuing commands)

Three important characteristics of Language
1 - Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified
2 - Fully Productive and Creative
3 - Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language
All human languages share these properties

Given that human languages seem to share some properties, and we're yet to find a group of humans without language, Some theorists have argued that this is evidence for Universal Grammar
An idea initially posited by Noam Chomsky
UG holds that there’s some genetic basis to human language
Some properties of human language are innate: Not just the ones to do with physical structures
There are a set of constraints governing language that are 'built in' to our physiology

UG is not facts about your individual language
A child of two Mandarin Chinese speakers, raised by English speakers, will speak English
Every language is not the same, and linguistic grammar varies substantially
UG is about biological predispositions to language, not to A language

Evidence for UG
No cultures, people, or societies have been found with no language
No other species has been found with human-like language
Children acquire language impressively well
Even in cultures where people don’t speak to children
Sign languages show similar properties to spoken languages
Even when they arise in isolation
Some things appear to be universal
The big one is Recursion

Evidence against UG
There doesn’t seem to be good biological evidence for it
Many properties of human language can be derived from functional facts about communication
Recursion might not be universal
Dan Everett (and others) claim that speakers of Piraha lack recursion
Even Chomksy doesn’t support this view anymore

Are elements of Linguistic structure innate?
There was a major change between the 9th (2010) and 11th (2018) editions of the textbook
Innatist arguments have gone from “unquestioned” to “questionable” in the field
Lots of smart folks have lined up on both sides of this argument
And there’s no sign of census yet

What isn’t Language?
Alternative means of coding languages
Semaphore and Morse Code, these are just re-coding an existing language
Writing systems - They're closely associated with an existing spoken or signed human language
Are programming languages languages?
Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified (yes), fully productive and creative (no), speakers have knowledge of grammar and the “rules” of language (yes)
So it is not

Do any non-humans have language?
Yes, but only one so far: Large Language Models can product human language
They have “passed the bar” for many linguists as competent language users
Most of the historical problems language models faced are now “solved”, this is different than saying “These are true AI”
They are much less efficient language learners children
Work is ongoing to see whether they can do more with less

Aside: ChatGPT has no plausible “universal grammar”
The code doesn’t include grammatical facts, a “language organ”, or innate grammatical patterns

What about living creatures? Lots of animals communicate
Mating calls, alert calls, territorial displays

Nim Chimpsky
A chimpanzee raised in a human family to learn ASL by Herbert Terrace
Learned maybe fewer than 125 signs, combined signs to produce 2-4 word utterances
Did not seem to have full-on language
Never got past 2-4 sign utterances, only 7% of utterances served to advance the conversation
39% of utterances were repetitions of what had just been signed
Entirely "pragmatic" use of language, Terrace argued that Nim never learned anything

But is it language?
We’ve only seen one domain of language
There's no sign of non-pragmatic language use

Do non-human animals have Language?
Nobody's truly doing human language yet
There's evidence of complex information being encoded, but we need more evidence before it's "language"

We think in language, regularly
So does the language we speak determine how we think? Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis
Also known as “linguistic relativity”, “the language you speak influences how you think about the world”
Fascinating and terrifying

There are many possible forms
No effect: “The language we speak has zero effect on our thought or cognition”
Weak: “The language we speak has some effect on our thought and cognition”
Strong: “The language we speak guides our thought and cognition”
Determinism: “The language we speak determines our thought and cognition”
There is some effect, but it's not deterministic. Debate is now focused on the size and nature of the effect

There can be many different variations of a language
Ex all are english, but are different: British English, African English, Australian English, . . 
Even American English can be broken down to The West, Upper Midwest, Southern, . . 
American Regional Dialect Tests
Syntax: “The gate needs fixed”, “I might could have some lunch”
These are regional characteristics
Pronunciation: “Pin” vs “Pen” (southern english), “Mary, marry, merry” (homogenized, usually pronounced the same)
Regional Vocabulary Differences
Dragonfly: Can also be called Mosquito hawk
Fizzy sweet beverage: pop / soda / soda-pop / coke / cooldrink
Not everyone from a region will have all of the dialect features
This is as much a function of attitude as location
Rootedness plays a major role
There are many more regions and regional features we haven’t covered

Sociolects
A sociolect is a dialect shared among members of a certain social group
People can have influence from more than one sociolect at once
We can often switch sociolects when in different social situations
Using a sociolect is a way of showing affiliation with a certain identity
Some sociolects have prestige, others don’t
. . and which dialect is prestigious varies by context
The bread and butter of sociolinguists

People can switch among their dialects and sociolects
California: Different groups, all overlap: Rural speakers, San Diegans, etc . .

Idiolect
You use language in a certain way, that way is your “idiolect”
Your esoteric pronunciations
The expressions and catch phrases that you use and prefer
The specific meanings that given words or phrases have to you
The features which you’ve inherited from you region(s) or social group(s)

More Idiolect features
Odd spellings or emojis you use (LOL vs lol, “Thanx”
Your individual set of speech organs (which may change the way your speech sounds)

Language is fractal
You see larger patterns at first
Then you look closer and find more patterns and structure, and find more patterns and structure, and . .

It’s very hard to find clear lines
It can be hard to define what is a single language
The distinction between language and dialect is often political
If you like them, they speak a dialect of your language, otherwise, whole different language
Everybody speaks at least one dialect, sociolect, and idiolect

We try to discuss variation in terms of languages, dialects, sociolects, and idiolects
Dialects are a particular form of language used by a certain social or geographical group of people
A sociolect is a particular social group’s specific dialect
Your idiolect is your unique way of using language and speaking
Your speech and language is a variable from situation to situation, from word to word
As you look closer and close at language, you find more patterns and complexity, not less

Linguists are interested in how everybody talks
Not just one prestigious or “correct” variety
Not just the academic or mainstream dialects
Not just what does in textbooks or dictionaries

We don’t tend to believe in a “correct variety” of a language
It’s hard to pin down which one would be correct
“Which region / dialect / sociolect / idiolect is right?”
The situationally “correct” or “appropriate” variety is about social context
“That variety is bad here” does not mean “that variety is bda”
“Correct” is a social judgment, not a linguistic one

So we think about “grammar” differently than your English professor

Perspective and Descriptive Grammar
The grammatical rules of the language, dialect, and sociolect being spoken which describe how (a group of) people actually talk or write

“The boy flame take watchingsly” is descriptively ungrammatical
“Grammatical” sentences are in harmony with the local rules
People “stumble” over ungrammatical sentences
When something is descriptively ungrammatical, it’s often hard to understand
Although not all hard-to-understand sentences are ungrammatical

Symbol Usage Note
Linguists mark ungrammatical sentences with a star, questionable ones with a ?
“The boy flame take watchingsly / ?Which friends has Thomas painted a picture of them?”

Dialects and Sociolects and Idiolects each have their own descriptive grammar
. . and they follow it

AAVE (African American Vernacular English, “Ebonics”)
Negative Concord, can’t nobody say he don’t work
*Nobody can say he doesn’t work
Habitual be
He be drivin all over the place
*He often drives all over the place lately
Copula deletion
She mean
*She’s mean
These grammatical rules are followed carefully by speakers of AAVE

It is patently false to claim that AAVE (or Chicano English, Souther English, etc) speakers “have no grammar”

Prescriptive Grammar
Made up or social rules that prescribe how people should talk or write

The “rules” being violated
I never know what I should write with
Never end a sentence with a preposition
I don’t know who she photographed
“Whom” should be used for a direct object
We hope to stunningly advance machine learning technology
How dare you split an infinitive, you ingrate

Prescriptive grammar rules are social rules
They are not universally observed
They do not generally affect your ability to be understood
They’re often based in written ambiguity (eg there, they’re, their)
They’re often quoted from one particular source (Strunk and White)
They’re often associated with a specific setting or institution

What other prescriptive grammar rules are you familiar with?
Let’s work on that distinction a bit more

Linguists are interested in descriptive grammar
We don’t believe there is a correct variety
A rule which a large number of people don’t follow isn’t a real rule
Or it’s not a rule in all dialects
And if you speak a non-standard variety, we think that’s great

It’s fun to see when prescriptive corrections are made
Sometimes, people truly believe the rules are real
Often, they’re trying to help
If you want to be taken seriously in [context], you’ll need to talk like this
Sometimes, they’re trying to show superiority
You bring an argument before me yet you cannot master even basic grammatical structure! Fool!

Attacking people’s language is often used as a covert way of attacking people
