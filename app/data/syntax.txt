Key Concepts in Syntax
1. Grammatical Relations
Understanding how a language marks the roles of subjects and objects.
English primarily uses word order to indicate these relations.
Variability in word order can still preserve the meaning but can also lead to ambiguity.
2. Constituency and Constituency Testing
Constituents: Groups of words that function together as a unit.
Constituency Tests: Methods to identify constituents, including:
Substitution: Replacing a chunk of a sentence with a placeholder.
Standalone Answers: Using parts of a sentence as complete answers to questions.
Movement: Rearranging chunks of a sentence while maintaining grammaticality.
3. Syntactic Hierarchy
Understanding that language is structured hierarchically, not flatly.
Words combine into phrases, and phrases combine into larger phrases or sentences.
4. Syntax Trees
Visual representations of sentence structure, highlighting the hierarchical organization.
Syntax trees demonstrate the underlying structure of sentences beyond specific words.
Practical Applications
Constituency is crucial for grasping the meaning of sentences.
Syntax trees help parse different interpretations and meanings of sentences.
Examples include understanding the scope of modifiers and resolving ambiguities in sentences like "I saw the man with the telescope."
Concluding Remarks
The lecture emphasizes the significance of word order, constituency, and hierarchical structure in understanding sentence syntax.
Upcoming lectures will focus on creating syntax trees and understanding the rules governing syntactic structure.

Main Topics Covered
1. Phrase Structure Rules
Explores rules governing the construction of different phrase types in English, like Noun Phrases (NP), Verb Phrases (VP), and Prepositional Phrases (PP).
Demonstrates how these rules dictate the structure and ordering of elements within phrases.
2. Building Syntax Trees
Instruction on creating syntax trees, which visually represent the structure of sentences.
Emphasis on hierarchical organization in language, showcasing how words combine into phrases and sentences.
3. Constituency Revisited
Re-examination of constituents, highlighting their role in building syntax trees.
Focus on how constituents are combined according to phrase structure rules.
4. Tree Construction Process
Step-by-step guide on constructing syntax trees, starting from identifying constituents and their types, and then applying phrase structure rules to build the tree.
Exploration of how different attachments in trees can change the meaning of sentences.
Key Concepts
Phrase Structure Rules: The backbone of constructing syntax trees, defining how various elements like nouns, verbs, and prepositions combine.
Syntax Trees: Tools to visually represent the hierarchical structure of sentences, crucial for understanding sentence syntax.
Noun Phrases and Verb Phrases: Basic building blocks in sentence construction, each with specific structure rules.
Complex Sentences: The concept of embedding one sentence within another using complementizers like "that" or "if", and how this affects tree structure.
Practical Applications
Understanding how word order and structure are crucial for the meaning of sentences.
Using syntax trees to parse and analyze complex sentences for better comprehension.
Recognizing the flexibility and complexity of English syntax.
Concluding Remarks
Emphasizes the importance of phrase structure rules in understanding sentence construction.
Highlights the complexity and hierarchical nature of language through the use of syntax trees.
Encourages further practice and exploration in tree construction for deeper understanding.

Questions to Answer
What is constituency and why is it important in syntax?
How do you test for constituency?
Be able to use all three tests we discussed in class (Substitution, Standalone Answers, Moving items)
Why do we represent sentences with hierarchy (e.g. trees) rather than as flat strings?
How is recursion implemented and visible in phrase structure rules?
Give a sentence which is a good argument for including N’ alongside NP and N in our phrase structure schema, and explain why? (hint: the little cute tiny black stray cat)
How can we distinguish different ‘readings’ of a structurally ambiguous sentence from the tree alone (e.g. “I saw the [Queen of England’s] Hat” vs. “I saw the Queen [of England’s Hat]”)?
Be able to match a sentence to a pre-constructed tree, using your phrase structure rules.
Be able to identify an incorrectly diagrammed sentence using your phrase structure rules.
